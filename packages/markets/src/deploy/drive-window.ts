/**
 * A Window the drive owns end to end, on drive-only Series 903: an attested primary and no check, 15 minutes long.
 *
 * A product that holds positions across a settlement (the leverage reserve, and whatever comes after it) has to be
 * proven at every ending: sold into a bid, knocked out under a line, paid on a win, written off on a loss. On a live
 * lane the book belongs to the maker and the print to the market, so a drive there proves whichever ending the day
 * happens to offer, and at a weekend it proves none. Here the drive rests both sides of the book and attests both
 * prints, so each ending is reached on purpose. Series 903 is never in the core ticker registry, so no app surface
 * lists it (D-027).
