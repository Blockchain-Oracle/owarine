/**
 * PreStocks pre-IPO tokens (Stocklana bounty track, D-100): one keyless read of the public catalogue, the price source
 * behind Agari's Pre-IPO lane. A PreStocks token is an SPV claim on a private company, so a row carries two prices —
 * `markPrice`, the SPV's valuation of the company, and `tokenPrice`, what the token itself trades at on Solana. The lane
 * prints `tokenPrice`, the only one a holder can realise; `markPrice` rides along for the UI and for the divergence the
 * two show (OPENAI traded ~11% over its mark on 2026-09-18).
 *
 * Both are floored to 10⁻⁸ from the JSON source text, never through a float: OPENAI quotes 15 significant digits, more
 * than a double keeps exactly. PreStocks signs nothing and publishes no timestamp, so a venue that settles on this must
 * attest the number with its own key and stamp its own read time — which is why the Pre-IPO lane is `SOURCE.attested`
 * (prints.md §4.3) and why the README says the venue, not PreStocks, is what a Pre-IPO settlement trusts.
 * `ops/prints/index.ts` re-exports all of it.
