/**
 * The live book for one market, normalised once by the coordinator and shared by every consumer.
 *
 * Keyed by market id so a stale page shows an empty book rather than the successor market's
 * liquidity (canon #3). Null while the watch is still hydrating — "…" rather than an empty book
 * nobody has actually read.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `depth` argument. Asking the live store for a second depth forks its
 * memo cache and makes it walk the whole resting-order map again; the reading carries
 * `CANONICAL_BOOK_DEPTH` levels and callers slice what they display out of it. The identity of the
 * returned reading is stable while the resting liquidity is unchanged, so slicing in a `useMemo`
 * downstream actually holds.
