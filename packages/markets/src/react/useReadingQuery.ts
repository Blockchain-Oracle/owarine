 * state and its retry policy. Domain failures still resolve as the error arm of a `Reading`,
 * because a revert is an answer, not an outage, and retrying it is noise.
 *
 * A failed *refresh* is not a rejection: `withReading` has already substituted the last-good
 * value and flipped `stale`, which is the behaviour worth keeping — a user watching a live
 * number would rather see the last true one labelled stale than an empty panel. Those retry
 * on the next poll rather than immediately.
