/**
 * `@agari/markets/ops`: what every S3 venue actor shares (docs/plan/specs/venue-ops.md §3–4). Server-only: clients are
 * built from role keypair bytes. Not re-exported from the package root. Each lane's surface is its own subpath,
 * `@agari/markets/ops/<lane>` (`src/ops/<lane>/index.ts`), so lanes never edit this file or package.json.
