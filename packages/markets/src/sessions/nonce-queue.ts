/**
 * One signing key, one writer.

 * Two writes racing from the same account collide on the nonce and one of them is lost or
 * replaced — which, on a write that moves money, is not an acceptable failure mode. Every
 * send from a session goes through this queue, so the account has exactly one transaction
 * in flight at a time.
 *
 * A failed task must not stall the queue behind it, so the chain continues regardless of
 * outcome while the caller still receives the original rejection.
