/**
 * `@agari/markets/sponsor`: the fee-payer co-sign (tap-trading.md §3, D-065). Server-only: the co-signer reads the
 * `sponsor` role key. Not re-exported from the package root, so no web bundle pulls it; the root carries only
 * `SponsorStatus`. The route is a thin handler over `createSponsorService`; nothing here sends a transaction.
