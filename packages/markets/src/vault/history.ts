 * keeps each owner's open positions in their `VaultAccount` (16 slots; a settled or sold-out slot is freed), so the
 * list of what is still held is complete by construction and needs no scan. It answered `complete: false` with an
 * empty list from the day the vault deployed, which held the strategy runner after its first cycle forever.
 *
 * What a slot does not record is what the position cost: the program keeps lots and the grant that opened them,
 * not cash. `costBase` is therefore 0 here and means "not recorded", which the open-bets row shows as no stake
 * line rather than a stake of zero. A closed round is not here at all; that history needs the vault's events indexed.
