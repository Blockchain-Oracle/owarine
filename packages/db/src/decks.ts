/**
 * The reveal material for a committed deck.
 *
 * One rule governs this table, and it is the reason it exists: **no durable reveal, no join.** A deck
 * commitment is published on chain at `createMatch`, and `revealDeck` re-hashes the preimage to open it.
 * Lose that preimage and the match can only ever refund — both pots home, nobody's fault, everybody's
 * disappointment. So the material is written here before a commitment is published anywhere, and the
 * matchmaker refuses to pair when it cannot write it (`06-game-architecture.md` §Matchmaking).
 *
 * It is stored sealed because `revealDeck` is permissionless: anyone holding this preimage can open the
 * deck early, which would hand one player the cards before the other. The key is not in the database.
