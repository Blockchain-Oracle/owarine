/**
 * Read-only index queries for S13's activity feeds (social-assistant.md §1.6): a wallet's inbox, the following feed and
 * a ticker hub. Nothing here writes `idx_*`. Integers leave Postgres as decimal strings; the web maps these rows to
 * `ActivityItem`s and derives each settlement's verdict with core's settlement rule.
 *
 * Two row shapes, one per source table:
 * - a fill row is one wallet's side of one `FillRecord` (`idx_fills`), with its own leg's notional already in base units;
 * - a settlement row is one wallet's seat on a terminal Window (`idx_positions` × `idx_markets`), carrying what was held
 *   at settlement, what it cost and returned, and whether and how the seat was redeemed.
 *
 * Drive-only Series (no registry symbol) never list, so they are nobody's activity, exactly as in wallet history.
