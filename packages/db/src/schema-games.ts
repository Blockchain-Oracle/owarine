/**
 * Stage 6's off-chain records: who a player is in the games, who they follow, how they like the stages
 * to feel, and a readable history of matches the arena already settled.
 *
 * The boundary this file must not blur: `GameArena` is the economic truth. `duel_matches` and
 * `duel_cards` are an **indexed projection** of its events, kept so a history page is one query rather
 * than a log replay — never a second opinion. Every economic row is therefore keyed by the chain's own
 * identity for the fact it records — a match id, or a pick's `chainId:matchId:cardIndex:seat`
 * coordinates — so re-indexing a block is idempotent, and any disagreement is settled by re-reading the
 * arena rather than by trusting a row here. Ratings, follows, settings and
 * arcade scores have no chain counterpart at all; they are this store's own.
 *
 * Writers (AD-7): `game_profiles`, `game_settings`, `game_follows` and `arcade_scores` → web (each
 * behind a signature check); `duel_matches`, `duel_cards` and `game_ratings` → ops (the projector and
 * the settler). Web never writes a rating: a ladder a browser can post to is not a ladder.
