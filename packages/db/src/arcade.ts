/**
 * Arcade scores: product state with no chain counterpart, and the one games table the web writes.
 *
 * A row is a run the server replayed. It is never updated: a wallet's best is the greatest of its rows,
 * a board is one row per wallet, and a rank is how many wallets have a greater best. Rows are keyed by
 * the engine build they were made on, because a score from another build is not comparable and must
 * not sit on the same board.
 *
 * Wallets take one canonical form at the write (`keys.ts`: base58 exact), and only here — the lesson `games.ts` records.
