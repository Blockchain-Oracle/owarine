 * why re-reading a block is harmless: the projector is free to be restarted, rewound or run twice.
 *
 * Money is stored as decimal strings. A `NUMERIC` would be exact too, but it arrives back as a string
 * from one driver and a float from another, and the moment one of those is a float a payout is wrong by
 * an amount nobody notices. Strings in, `BigInt` out, at the one seam that knows.

 * It is not tidiness. Masayume's reads filtered on a lowercased form of what the caller passed, while the
 * writes took whatever the decoder produced — and viem returns a checksummed address from an event
 * log. So `duel_matches` filled up with `0xec71498B...` while `listLiveMatches` asked for
 * `0xec71498b...`, and matched nothing, ever. The settler read "no live match in the projection"
 * through a real duel sitting one row away: no deck revealed, no card settled, no pot awarded, and
 * `activeMatchFor` could never tell a reconnecting browser which match it was in. Found by the first
 * drive that ran the settler and a browser against the same database (2026-09-04). On Solana the same rule must NOT
 * lowercase: base58 is case-sensitive, so addresses and Market ids are kept exactly and only hex folds (D-010).
