/**
 * The social store's schema. Social records only; chain truth is never stored here.
 *
 * Inline rather than a `.sql` file read at runtime: a bundler does not carry loose
 * files next to the module that reads them, so a schema loaded off disk works in
 * dev and fails on deploy — the worst place to find out. This travels with the code
 * that runs it.
 *
 * Idempotent, so applying it twice is safe and it can run on first use.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here: any claim about who may read or post. That gate is
 * the chain's — the route checks the caller holds a position before it will accept
 * a row — and a second copy of the rule in a constraint is how the two drift apart.
