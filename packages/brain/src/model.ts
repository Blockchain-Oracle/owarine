/**
 * Which model answers as Sensei — server only.
 *
 * The first cut called the Anthropic SDK directly, which meant the provider was a
 * code change rather than a setting. This resolves a model from configuration
 * instead, through the Vercel AI SDK's uniform interface, so Claude, GPT, Gemini or
 * anything speaking the OpenAI protocol are the same call with a different string.
 *
 * One variable does it:
 *
 *   AI_MODEL="anthropic/claude-opus-5"   (the default)
 *   AI_MODEL="openai/gpt-5.4"
 *   AI_MODEL="google/gemini-3-5-flash"
 *
 * and the resolver takes whichever route the available credential allows:
 *
 *   1. AI_BASE_URL + AI_API_KEY  → any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. This is the
 *      escape hatch for OpenRouter, Together, Groq, vLLM, a local Ollama — none of
 *      which needs a package of its own, because they all speak that protocol.
 *   2. the named provider's own key (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY,
 *      GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY) → that provider directly.
 *   3. AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY → Vercel's AI Gateway, which takes the whole
 *      `creator/model` string and routes it. One key, every provider.
 *   4. nothing → `null`, and the route says so. The dock renders in full either way.
 *
 * Direct keys are tried before the gateway on purpose: a key you already hold
 * should not need a gateway account to be useful.
 *
 * **What this trades away.** The Anthropic SDK exposes things no portable interface
 * can: server-side refusal fallbacks, explicit `cache_control` breakpoints, adaptive
 * thinking's `display`. Those are gone. What survives is the part that matters here
 * — reasoning effort is a *portable* top-level parameter in AI SDK 7, so `low` means
 * low effort on Claude and on GPT alike, without a branch per provider.
