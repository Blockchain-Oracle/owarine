/**
 * A pre-open call's quote (D-088): a post-only order at the user's own price, sized from the stake on the Series grid.
 * Pure integer math, mirroring `matching/paths.rs::cash_of`: a resting buy escrows `lots × own_ticks × cash_unit`, where
 * a YES kind's own ticks are the YES price and a NO kind's are `1000 − p`. UP at c¢ is BUY_YES at `c × 10` ticks; DOWN
 * at c¢ is BUY_NO at `1000 − c × 10` in YES terms, so both escrow `c × 10` ticks per lot. It returns the same `Quote`
 * shape a taker's walk does, so funding, the order build and the CTA read it unchanged.
