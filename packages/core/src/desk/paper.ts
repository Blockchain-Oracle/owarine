/**
 * The practice ledger (desk.md §7). A practice desk is a database row with no on-chain account: every check runs the
 * full pipeline on real prices and real Jupiter quotes at the desk's size, and a "would have acted" moves this ledger
 * instead of a token account. Valuation, needs, the gate and the grade run on it exactly as on a live desk.
 *
 * The fee: PreStocks charges 100 bps on every transfer of every name. Whether Jupiter's `outAmount` already nets it is
 * measured at C6.E on the mainnet fork; until then the paper ledger takes `feeBps` off the received leg in both
 * directions, and a measured 0 switches it off. Conservative on purpose: a practice record must never look better than
 * the live desk would have done.
