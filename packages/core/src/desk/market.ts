/**
 * What the market looks like for one candidate, right now (desk.md §8). Pure: the ops runner reads the sources and
 * fills this in; core only defines the shape and the arithmetic over it. Three prices, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 *   spot      the venue-attested PreStocks token price this instant: the reference the PROGRAM measures its 8 % band
 *             and the premium against (`DeskRef.token_price_e8`)
 *   mean      the 30-minute mean of the same reads: what holdings are valued on, and what "moving fast" is measured on
 *   mark      PreStocks' own valuation per token (`markPrice`); the premium is spot against mark: "above its mark"
 *   index     Pyth's `Equity.Index.<NAME>/USD` valuation, when the venue is entitled to it (D-125); null otherwise
 *
 * What the trade itself costs is measured separately, for its exact size, so a fee is never mistaken for a discount.
