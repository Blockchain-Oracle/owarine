/**
 * Copy a human (A-3b).
 *
 * The signal is not a model: it is what one named wallet actually did on this Window, as the index recorded it.
 * A trader who bought UP and then sold half of it back has a smaller call, not two calls, so the fills are netted
 * in YES terms before a side is taken — buying NO and selling YES both lean the same way.
 *
 * What this cannot be is the same trade. A copier's order is sent after the trader's landed, into whatever the book
 * holds then, so the price differs and the fill may be smaller or nothing at all. The surface says so.
 *
 * It also cannot see everything that wallet does. The index records a fill's **taker**, and a call routed through a
 * Trading Balance or the private desk is taken by a program seat on the owner's behalf — so those calls are not
 * attributable to the wallet here and are not copied. What is copied is what the wallet does from its own wallet,
 * which is how a person's own calls are placed; the studio says this where a trader is chosen.
