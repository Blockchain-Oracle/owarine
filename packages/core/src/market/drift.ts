 * Directional drift over a window — ported from `computeDrift` in
 * `reference/yosuku/components/SenseiTape.tsx`.
 *
 * Two honest properties are the point of it, and both are the reference's own:
 *
 *  - It is measured on the **same feed that settles Windows**, so the number
 *    Sensei reasons from is the number that will decide the bet.
 *  - `spanMin` is the span the samples actually cover, not the span asked for. A
 *    minute-old history asked for a 15-minute drift reports 1, so the label under
 *    it cannot claim a window the data does not have.
 *
 * `flatBandRaw` is the movement below which this reads as flat rather than as a
 * direction. The reference hardcodes $3 on BTC; it is a parameter here because the
 * venue lists assets whose whole price is smaller than that.
