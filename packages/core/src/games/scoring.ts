 * Who won, and how the side-pot is allocated.

 * The score is real money, not points: each card contributes `payout − actualCost`, both measured by the
 * arena around the fill rather than quoted by a screen. A voided card is not skipped — DreamDEX pays its
 * real 0.5 redemption, so that payout is what counts (`06-game-architecture.md` §/games/duel).
 *
 * The pot is allocated in base units with no division that can lose a unit: an odd split gives the
 * remaining unit to the creator, deterministically, so two independent settlers agree.
