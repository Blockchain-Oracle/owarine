/**
 * The credential that opens a duel room, and the message the browser's own key signs to get one.
 *
 * A WebSocket upgrade is a GET with no body, so whatever authenticates it has to fit in a string that
 * the browser can attach and the room server can check without asking anything else. That string is this
 * token: claims plus a MAC over them, minted by the web app after it has verified a signature, and
 * verified by the ops room server against the same shared secret.
 *
 * **The wallet does not sign this.** Flicky's room takes a bare `hello(address)` and lets the chain be the
 * authority for everything that costs money; the wallet signs nothing before the entry. Here the browser's
 * game key — the key the entry transaction will name as the seat's agent — signs a message that claims a
 * wallet, so the room asks the wallet for no prompt at all and still holds a signature it can check. Before
 * the entry the claim is exactly as trusted as the reference's `hello`; from the entry on, the arena's own
 * `agentOf(matchId, wallet)` is what the room checks a socket's key against, so a key the chain never named
 * cannot sit in a seat's room (`handlers.ts` §sendSnapshot).
 *
 * Three properties are deliberate.
 *
 * **It is bound to one arena on one cluster.** A token minted for the devnet deployment cannot open a room
 * on another (`chainId` holds the numeric cluster id, D-010), which is the same rule the deck commitment enforces on-chain.
 *
 * **It carries two clocks.** `issuedAtMs` bounds how long one token is good for — fifteen minutes, so a
 * copied URL is not a durable credential — while `sessionEndsAtMs` bounds how long the *signature* behind
 * it may keep minting new ones. A re-mint costs no prompt now, but a token that renews rather than re-signs
 * is one fewer thing for a phone mid-swipe to do.
 *
 * **No crypto lives here.** `@agari/core` stays free of platform dependencies, so the HMAC is passed in
 * — the same shape `verifyDeckCommitment` uses for keccak. Both callers hold one line of `node:crypto`
 * each; everything that could be got subtly wrong — the claim order, the clock comparisons, the arena
 * binding — is here, and tested once.
 *
 * This is not the Stage 3 comment Room's token (`web/src/features/room/gate.server.ts`), which gates a
 * market's chat on holding a position. Same idea, different room and different claim.
