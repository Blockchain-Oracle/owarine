/**
 * Practice, as pure data: the deck a player learns the motion on, the opponent that is a coin flip,
 * and the rule that scores a card without any money, any chain and any invented number.
 *
 * **What practice is honest about.** A duel card is scored on the venue's own settlement — payout
 * minus the cost the arena measured around a real fill. Practice cannot wait fifteen minutes for
 * that, so it scores a different question and must say so: the card asks the Window's question, and
 * practice answers it on the **live public spot over a short watch**. Every price here is a real
 * feed reading; nothing is simulated. What is *not* claimed is that this is a settlement, a payout,
 * a position or a real opponent (`04-game-system.md` §Practice and arcade state).
 *
 * **Why one close moment for every card.** Each card records its own entry price when it is swiped,
 * and every card is then scored at the same instant the watch ends. A per-card timer would give the
 * first card a longer run than the last, which would make the deck's order part of the result — a
 * bias the player never chose.

 * left was dealt, counted down to 0:00 under the player's hand and read as broken. Practice scores
 * on the feed rather than on the Window, so nothing was actually wrong with the score — but a card
