/**
 * The one match lifecycle every duel surface derives from, as data rather than component booleans.
 *
 * Two properties matter more than the shape. The reducer is **total**: an event that does not apply to
 * the current phase returns the state unchanged, because a reconnecting client replays events it may
 * already have applied and a WebSocket may deliver them late or twice. And a `resync` always wins —
 * chain and database snapshots are the only things allowed to move economic UI, so a server snapshot
 * overrides whatever the client believed (`06-game-architecture.md` §Matchmaking, realtime and reconnect).
 *
 * Sequence numbers are deliberately absent: they are advisory. Idempotency comes from each receipt's
 * `pickKey` — the card and seat it belongs to — which is why `pickConfirmed` can be applied twice, and
 * why a card's settlement fills in the receipt its pick already wrote.
