/**
 * The arcade's fixed world.
 *
 * Both engines simulate a 640×360 field at 60 steps a second, whatever the canvas that draws them
 * measures. That is what makes a run replayable: Pips's engines step on the frame's `dt` and read the
 * canvas's own width to decide how many line points or candles exist, so the same inputs on a phone and
 * a monitor produce different runs — and a server has no canvas at all. Here a run is a seed and a list
 * of inputs by tick, and the field they played on is this file.
 *
 * Nothing here calls `Math.sin`, `Math.exp` or `Math.pow`: those are not required to agree bit for bit
 * across JavaScript engines, and a score that replays to a different number on the server than in the
 * browser is a refused score. Every operation in the simulation is `+ − × ÷`, `min`, `max`, `abs`,
 * `floor` and `round`, which IEEE 754 fixes exactly.
