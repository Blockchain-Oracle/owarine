/**
 * The arcade's dice: xorshift32, seeded from eight hex characters.
 *
 * Pips's engines draw their line and their candles from `Math.random`, which is exactly the thing a
 * replay cannot have. Every draw here comes from a generator whose whole state is one 32-bit word, so a
 * seed and the inputs that followed it reproduce a run to the tick — on the browser that played it and
 * on the server that checks it. The generator is deliberately the simplest one that is good enough
 * for a scrolling line: eleven operations, no allocation, no dependency.
 *
 * A seed is a string on the wire and in the database so it is never mistaken for a count, and eight
 * lowercase hex characters so it is exactly the 32 bits the generator holds — no more, no less.
