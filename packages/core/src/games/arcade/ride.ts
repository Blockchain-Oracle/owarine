/**
 * Line Rider's mechanics, as a pure step over a state.
 *
 * Pips's `rideEngine.ts`, re-expressed: a trend line scrolls in from the right and the player rides a
 * pip on it. Hug the line and the score climbs — faster the tighter the hug, through a combo multiplier —
 * and grip refills; drift off and the combo decays while grip drains; grip empty, run over. Speed and
 * the tolerance band ramp after a warm-up, and past the ramp the speed keeps creeping so every run
 * eventually breaks, which is what makes a high score worth chasing.
 *
 * What is different from the reference is what makes it checkable: the field is fixed (`field.ts`), the
 * step is fixed, every random draw comes from the seeded generator, and the only input is one byte a
 * tick — where the wheel is. Nothing visual lives here; trails, sparks and heat colour are the draw
 * module's, and they read this state rather than steer it.
