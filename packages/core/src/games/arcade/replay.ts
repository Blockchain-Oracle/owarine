/**
 * A run, played again from its seed and its inputs — the server's whole check.
 *
 * The browser records what it did; the server does the same thing with the same dice and looks at the
 * number. A run that ends where the browser said it ended, on the score the browser said, is a run
 * that happened. It does not prove the browser was not driven by a script — nothing in a browser can —
 * which is why the board says "server-checked" and no money ever rides on these scores.
 *
 * After the last recorded input the wheel holds and the button is silent, and the run plays out to its
 * end on its own: a line leaves a still pip, a flyer without a press falls. So a replay always finishes,
 * and one that is still running at the budget is refused rather than trusted.
