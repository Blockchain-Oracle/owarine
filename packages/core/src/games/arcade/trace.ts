/**
 * What a run is, on the wire: the inputs, by tick.
 *
 * A ride trace is a flat list of `tick, targetQ` pairs — the wheel's byte at the ticks it changed, so a
 * player holding still costs nothing. A hop trace is the ticks that were pressed. Both are plain
 * integer arrays: a few hundred bytes for a typical run, and never more than the replay budget allows.
 *
 * The envelope is the cheap refusal before the replay: a score no run of that length could reach, a
 * trace that claims inputs after the run ended, a shape that is not a trace at all. It is a bound, not
 * a check — a score inside the envelope is still only accepted once the replay reproduces it.
