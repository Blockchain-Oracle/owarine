 * What a room accepts from one connection, as data both sides can read.

 * stay inside it. A swipe stage that sends a `pick.pending` on every pointer move would otherwise learn
 * the rate only by being disconnected mid-match, and the player would experience a griefing defence as
 * a bug. The same table therefore throttles the browser and enforces the server.
 *
 * A token bucket rather than a fixed window: a burst is exactly what real use looks like — three
 * reactions when a card lands, then nothing for a minute — and a fixed window either refuses that burst
 * or permits twice the rate across a boundary.
