/**
 * The deckmaster's selection rule, pure so it can be tested without a venue.
 *
 * The owner approved the recommended policy: three to five distinct 15m Windows, widening to 1h only
 * when fewer than three qualify, and **never 5m** until live timing proves the whole swipe-and-signature
 * path fits inside one (`06-game-architecture.md` §Owner decisions 4). The headroom rule is Flicky's —
 * soonest-settling first, but only Windows with real time left, so a deck cannot be dealt cards that
 * lock before a player can reach them.
 *
 * **The mixed lane is not a third preference; it is what the venue forced.** Driven live on Shannon on
 * 2026-09-03, the venue runs two assets, one Window per cadence: at any moment there are exactly two
 * live 15m Windows and two live 1h ones, so a three-card deck of a single cadence is not merely rare —
 * it is impossible. Refusing to deal would have made the duel undeliverable. The single-cadence lanes
 * stay first because they are the nicest to read, and a mixed deck is dealt only when neither has three.
 *
 * What the single-cadence rule was protecting is protected by the filters that remain: every card must
 * be tradable now, must still have real life left, and must settle inside the match horizon — so a
 * mixed deck varies in how long each card runs, never in whether a player can reach it. Both players
 * hold identical cards either way; the asymmetry a mixed deck introduces is between cards, not between
 * players, and each card carries its own countdown on the stage.
 */

/**
 * Two, not three, and the reason is the venue's supply rather than a preference.
 *
 * Somnia runs two assets with one Window per cadence, so a cadence yields at most TWO live Windows —
 * and the 15m cadence is too short to absorb the arena's own deadlines (join + reveal + card life is
 * 540s of a 900s cycle at the deployed parameters), which leaves the 1h pair as the dependable supply.
 * At three, a deck was dealable 40% of the time; at two, 90% (owner's decision, 2026-09-03, measured by
 * `spike:supply`). Doc 06 §Owner decisions 4 said three to five; this is the approved deviation.
 *
 * A two-card duel is a coarser contest — more ties, more luck — which is why it stays the floor rather
 * than the target: `selectDeck` still takes every eligible Window up to `DECK_MAX`, so a deck is four
 * cards whenever the venue has four.
