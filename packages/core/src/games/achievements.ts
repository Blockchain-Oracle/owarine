 * What a player has actually done, and the badges that follow from it.
 *
 * Every rule is a plain predicate over facts already recorded elsewhere: duels the projector wrote from the arena's
 * own events, arcade scores the room's token vouched for, lucky draws the venue settled. Nothing here is a counter of
 * its own, so a badge can never drift from the record it claims — and a wallet that plays on another device arrives
 * with the same badges, because the facts are the chain's and the store's, not the browser's.
 *
 * Pure: the caller gathers the facts.
