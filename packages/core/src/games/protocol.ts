/**
 * The duel room's protocol: every message the browser and the ops room server may exchange, and the
 * one function that turns a server message into reducer events.
 *
 * Three rules are enforced by the shape rather than by the server's care.
 *
 * **No client message carries money.** There is no client message with a cost, a size, a payout or a
 * result in it, so no amount of server bugs can let a browser assert one. The economic messages —
 * `pick.confirmed`, `settlement.progress`, `match.finalized` — exist only in the server union, and the
 * server only ever builds them from a chain log (`06-game-architecture.md`: "Only snapshots/events from
 * chain and Postgres can change economic UI").
 *
 * **`pick.pending` names a card, never a side.** It is the "your opponent is deciding" cue. Relaying the
 * direction would hand the other player a live read on a card they still hold, for the seconds before
 * the chain makes it public anyway; the field simply does not exist, so it cannot be leaked by mistake.
 *
 * **Sequence numbers are absent.** They would be advisory here (`lifecycle.ts` says why): the reducer is
 * total and receipts are keyed by chain log identity, so a duplicate delta is a no-op and a missed one is
 * repaired by the next `snapshot`. A counter would only invite a client to trust ordering it cannot verify.
