 * One arena event, as the messages a room should send — the projector's whole translation, pure.

 * It is pure so the interesting cases can be tested without a chain: a settlement that arrives for a
 * pick this process never saw, a lock that forfeits one seat, a finalize with no winner. The projector
 * around it does two things this cannot — reads blocks and writes rows — and nothing else.
 *
 * The rule it exists to keep: **every economic message is built from a log, never from a client.** A
 * receipt's cost and size are the ones the arena measured around the fill, and the only way one reaches
 * a browser is through this function.
