 * `POST /api/rpc` — the browser's Solana endpoint, same-origin.
 *
 * D-035 left this open: "browsers use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL`, which defaults to public devnet … there is no
 * `/api/rpc` proxy in S4; revisit at S16." This is that revisit. Public devnet answers a few requests a second for
 * the whole internet, so on a hosted deployment a connected wallet's reads — the vault snapshot behind X trading,
 * the Trading Balance, a position — fail often enough that the surfaces say so: "X trading status unavailable",
 * "We could not verify your balance and trading permission."
 *
 * The key never reaches the page: it is read here and spent on the upstream request, exactly as `/api/holdings`
 * spends the mainnet one. `methods` is an allowlist rather than a deny-list, because this endpoint is public and an
 * open proxy to a paid provider is somebody else's budget. WebSockets are not proxied — a Next route handler cannot
 * — so `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_WS_URL` stays on the public endpoint, which is what the operator clients already do for
 * subscriptions (D-030).
