/**
 * `/demo` — ported from `reference/yosuku/app/demo/page.tsx`.
 *
 * The reference's structure is kept line for line; every claim is rewritten to what Agari does on Solana devnet.
 * Two of the reference's promises do not hold here and are not repeated: calls are not gas-free by default (the
 * wallet pays SOL; the faucet tops a short wallet up), and there is no native mobile build (the web app installs
 * as a PWA). The video is Agari's own walkthrough, hosted on YouTube, and nothing here names an X handle.
