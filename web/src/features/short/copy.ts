/**
 * `/short` — A-1b, the inverse position.
 *
 * The reference has no short: its leverage is a chip inside the Up/Down ticket and a row in the portfolio's bet
 * list, which frames a boost as amplifying a call held to the bell. Nothing here overrides those words — the
 * ticket's chips and `LeverageBetRow` keep the reference's copy exactly. These are the words for the surface the
 * reference does not have, in the venue's own voice.
 *
 * The premium and the knock-out line are the reserve's parameters, not constants, so every sentence that names
 * one takes it from the reserve that is actually deployed.
