 * The Room's gate machine — ported from `reference/yosuku/lib/sui/useCommentRoom.ts`.
 *
 *   unavailable  no social store configured on this deployment
 *   connect      no wallet
 *   locked       wallet, but no position on this Window — cannot speak
 *   joinable     has a position, not yet joined → one signature
 *   joining      signature in flight
 *   joined       member: thread and composer, polled live
 *
 * The reference runs two identities: the login wallet gates the position, and a
 * separate Ed25519 delegate does all the messaging, because its messaging SDK
 * rejects zkLogin's signature scheme. That whole apparatus exists to work around a
 * constraint we do not have — an ordinary EVM `personal_sign` is exactly what the
 * server can verify — so there is one identity here, and the wallet that holds the
 * position is the wallet that speaks.
 *
 * The reference's `alsoTry` is gone with it: it exists because its ticket silently
 * rolls a bet onto the next round, leaving the room pinned to a round you did not
 * bet. Our ticket does not roll, so the Room is always about the Window you opened.
 *
 * One signature per hour, not per opening: the join token is remembered per wallet and
 * market (`room-session.ts`), so closing the sheet and opening it again lands on
 * `joined` with the thread, and the wallet is only asked again once the token has aged out.
 *
 * `marketId` is any room id (`room-id.ts`): a Window's Market id, or a ticker's `$TSLA`.
