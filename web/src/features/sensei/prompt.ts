 * someone not to take a bet. What changed is only what is no longer true here —
 * the chain, the venue, the fact that this venue lists more than Bitcoin, and the
 * pricing model. That last one matters most: Yosuku prices off a house model, so
 * its two sides sum to a dollar. DreamDEX has a real book on each side, so they
 * do not, and a model left to assume otherwise would quietly do `100 - x`
 * arithmetic and state the answer as fact.
 *
 * This string is the stable prefix, so it must not carry anything per-turn — a
 * provider that caches a prompt prefix can only do so while the prefix is
 * byte-identical between turns.
