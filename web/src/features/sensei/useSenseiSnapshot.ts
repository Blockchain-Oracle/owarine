 * What Sensei is looking at — built from the lane set the page already holds.

 * open, plus a second history poll inside `SenseiTape`. Both are readings `/markets`
 * is already streaming, so this takes them as arguments instead: one market stream
 * on the page, and a price Sensei quotes can never disagree with the price on the
 * card behind the drawer.
 *
 * `useTopOfBook` is called a fixed four times against a possibly-null market rather
 * than in a loop, so the hook count is constant and every Window Sensei is told
 * about carries a real book. The reference sends no odds at all — its model would
 * have had nothing to read them from.
