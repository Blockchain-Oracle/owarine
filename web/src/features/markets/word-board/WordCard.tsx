/**
 * One Window as a plain question with a price on each answer.
 *
 * The reference invents both numbers on this card: the line comes from `strike624`
 * (a strike derived from spot) and the odds from `probAbove`, a client-side logistic
 * model — "an honest client-side odds estimate", in its own words. Both are barred
 * by doc 05 §No-fake-data, and neither is needed, because this venue has a real
 * opening print and a real book. So the level is the print the Window settles
 * against and the prices are the top of the book, exactly as the hero's UP/DOWN
 * buttons read them.
 *
 * That has one visible consequence worth knowing: the reference prints No as
 * `100 - yes`, because its model produces a single probability. Here each side is
 * its own contract with its own ask, so the two do not sum to 100 and neither is
 * derived from the other. Only the bar is a derivation, and it says so.
