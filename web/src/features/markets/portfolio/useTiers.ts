 * all — does not start until the critical tier has answered, so the balance and the open bets
 * are not queued behind it. And when every critical read has failed for the same reason, that
 * reason is one fact about the connection, not five independent panel failures: reporting it
 * once with one retry is the difference between an outage and a page of competing buttons.
 *
 * A partial failure is deliberately *not* an outage. If the balance loaded and only claims
 * failed, the page is still useful and that section owns its own error.
