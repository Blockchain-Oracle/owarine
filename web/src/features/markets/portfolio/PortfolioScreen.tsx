/**
 * Portfolio — the money, the open bets, and what is waiting to be collected.
 *
 * Ported from `reference/yosuku/app/portfolio/page.tsx`. Its structural claim is
 * that the page has no headline: "the nav already says where you are, and the
 * thing people open this page for is the number", so the balance plate opens the
 * page and everything else sits under it.
 *
 * The plate itself is the one already live on `/markets` rather than the
 * reference's `.ledger-plate`. That frame is a fixed cream slab with its own ink,
 * and the panel inside it is theme-aware — nesting them would have produced, in
 * reverse, exactly the "one card, two backgrounds" defect the reference's own
 * `.plate-rows` remap exists to fix.
 *
 * The settled history, the equity curve, reputation and badges read the fill
 * projection (`useWalletHistory`), and the Trader Edge link opens the report built
 * from the same reading. The Trading Balance is the vault's pool row inside the plate,
 * with its controls folded into the row the way the reference folds the X wallet's
 * (`PoolRows` panels). What still needs a capability we have not built — creator
 * earnings, the X wallet — keeps a named dependency state instead of a plausible-looking panel.
