 * The reference's 1×/2×/3× chips, verbatim (`Ticket624Drawer.tsx` L1074–1090): three small mono buttons on
 * the amount block's right, the chosen one in vermilion, the others disabled with a title where a boost
 * cannot be placed — exactly as the reference disables them for a private bet. 1× is a plain order; a
 * higher multiple is a boost the reserve buys. The 2026-09-02 sliding highlight was reverted with the rest
 * of the leverage redesign on 2026-09-04.
 *
 * One word the reference only puts in the group's `aria-label`: "Leverage", printed beside the chips in the
 * Ticket's own control-label type, because the owner found that nobody reading 1×/2×/3× knew what they were
 * (2026-09-04). The enabled boosts carry the one-line explanation as their title.
