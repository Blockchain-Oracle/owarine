 * Windows in the reel — one per asset and lane, soonest bell first, capped.

 * Yosuku's reel is `fetchMarkets624`: one live round per cadence, three cards, kept while
 * `expiry - now > minMintMs(cadence) * 0.6` and sorted by expiry (`app/reels/page.tsx` L268–273).
 * The venue here lists more than one asset and its lanes hold more than one Window each, so the
 * same bound is taken per asset and lane — the soonest Window still in the reel — and the feed
 * stops at REEL_CAP rather than growing with the venue. It had grown to a hundred cards.
 *
 * Membership derives from `phase()`, since the entry cutoff already lives in core as the no-entry
 * buffer, rather than a second copy of the heuristic. A Window inside the buffer stays on screen
 * and says it is closing; one that has locked is gone.
