 * One Window as a framed portrait card — the question, the tape, and the call.
 *
 * Ported from `reference/yosuku/app/reels/page.tsx` (`ReelCard`, L57) over the DreamDEX pipeline.
 * Everything on it is a real read: the round comes from the live lanes, the line is the on-chain
 * opening print, the price is the feed the Window settles on. Nothing here is a placeholder number.
 *
 * Memoised, and the clock stays out of its props: the head reads the clock itself, `closing` is a
 * fact that changes once, so a card off screen re-renders when its Window changes and not sixty
 * times a minute. Every live read is gated on `near`: the lane set already carries each Window's
 * opening print (one read for the whole reel), and the per-card refinement plus the price
 * subscription belong only to the card on screen and its two neighbours — the reference gates its
 * redraw the same way, on an IntersectionObserver.
