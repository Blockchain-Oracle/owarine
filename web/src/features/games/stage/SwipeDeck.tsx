/**
 * The deck as a gesture: one card at a time, thrown up for UP and down for DOWN.
 *
 * Three things about the shape are deliberate.
 *
 * **The face is a slot.** This component knows a card's identity and nothing about money, so
 * Practice and the Duel are the same motion over different faces — which is the point of building
 * Practice first (`06-game-architecture.md` §Owner decisions 1: the two ship together because they
 * share the swipe loop).
 *
 * **The buttons are not a fallback.** Doc 04 requires a keyboard and pointer alternative to every
 * swipe, so the two calls are always rendered and always sufficient; the drag is the flourish on
 * top. That is also why turning motion off removes the drag and loses nothing. They are drawn as the
 * reference's fifth band — the YES/NO chips with a side's odds on each (`swipe-screen.tsx` L407–451).
 *
 * **A refusal is not a failure.** `refusal` is for a card the chain would not take right now — the
 * arena's own entry gate — and it holds the card in place with its reason rather than letting a
 * player throw it at a transaction that would revert. A locked side is the same idea for one side of
 * one card: the book cannot fill that side at this stake, so the throw springs back with the reason.
