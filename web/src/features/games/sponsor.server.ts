/**
 * The games' sponsor — server only. Nothing here may be imported by a component.
 *
 * Flicky sponsors every transaction through an address-balance relayer, so a player signs nothing and
 * pays nothing per card. On Solana the vault's lane has the sponsor co-sign as fee payer; the arena's agent is
 * the pick's own signer, so the same sponsor pays the duel's fees another way — it sends SOL to the seat's key, and
 * the key pays for its own picks. What makes that safe is the order: the sponsor funds only a key
 * the arena has already named for a live seat (`agentOf(match, player)`), once per seat per match, up to
 * the deck's own envelope, under the same per-address and per-device gates the vault's lane uses. A key
 * the chain never named gets nothing, which is what stops the route being a faucet.
 *
 * The same `SPONSOR_PRIVATE_KEY` funds both lanes: one operator key, one balance to watch. The policy is
 * the vault's own (AD-15) — the sponsor never puts capital in; an entry that escrows a pot is the player's
 * transaction, and only the picks' fees are the sponsor's.
