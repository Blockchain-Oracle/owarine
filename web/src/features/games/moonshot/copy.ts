 * Moonshot — Pips' direction-and-reach call (`moonshot.tsx`: "scroll up to go LONG, down to go SHORT, and

 * venue: the level is solved by the house's Range model on the live reserve, it settles on the Window's
 * own oracle print, and the whole payout is set aside up front. Nothing here is a chart line or an estimate:
 * the level, the odds and the multiple are the contract's own.
