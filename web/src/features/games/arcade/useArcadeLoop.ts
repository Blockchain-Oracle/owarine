/**
 * The canvas as a surface, and the loop that drives a simulation over it.
 *
 * The simulation is stepped at exactly 60 Hz whatever the display does: a frame's elapsed time goes
 * into an accumulator and the engine steps while there is a whole step in it, then the draw is handed
 * the fraction left over so it can interpolate between the last two states. A 120 Hz screen draws
 * twice per step and sees smooth motion; a 30 Hz one steps twice per draw and sees the same run. A
 * stall — a tab switch, a long task — is clamped to a tenth of a second so the sim never lurches, and
 * the loop is stopped altogether while the document is hidden, then restarted with a fresh clock.
 *
 * The surface owns the device-pixel ratio: the canvas's backing store is sized to the element's box
 * times the ratio (capped at two, past which nothing is sharper and a phone pays for it), and the draw
 * receives a transform that maps the fixed 640×360 field onto it, so every draw call is in field
 * units and nothing else knows how big the screen is.
