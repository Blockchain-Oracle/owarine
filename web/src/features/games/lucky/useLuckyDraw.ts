 * One spin, from the tap to the row it leaves: the server's commitment first, then this browser's seed,
 * then the deal — and after the deal, whatever the Ticket lane came back as, reported so the row is
 * honest about it.
 *
 * The reels cycle from the tap. `committing` and `spinning` both keep them moving; the deal's arrival
 * starts the staggered stops, and only when the last reel has landed does the phase become `dealt` or
 * `refused`, which is when the card appears. Pips' reels do the same: the round trip hides inside the
 * spin, so a multi-second deal feels instant.
