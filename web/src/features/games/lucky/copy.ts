/**
 * Everything Lucky says.
 *
 * Two sentences here carry the mode's honesty and must never be softened. The draw is provable, and the
 * card says exactly what that proves — that the reels were not changed after the seed was committed —
 * and not what it does not: the Window was chosen from a hashed candidate set by a rule the server
 * followed, which is recorded, not proven. And the order is one real order at the LIVE quote: the reel
 * dealt a reach, the book decides the multiple, and when the two have parted the card says so before
 * anything is signed (`04-game-system.md` §Mode truth, `06-game-architecture.md` §/games/lucky).
