 * What a mode is to a player standing in the hub.
 *
 * The name, one-line blurb, icon and href come from the navigation registry rather than being
 * restated here: a mode that is called one thing in the header and another on its card is a
 * defect no test would catch. The economic kind comes from `@agari/core/games`, so the card's
 * honest label about whose money is at risk is the same fact the write lanes gate on.
 *
 * `readiness` is a build fact, not a chain read — it says whether the thing behind the route
 * exists in this repository yet. Range and Moonshot share Stage 5's reserve; the hub adds the
 * reserve's *live* state on top of that, because "built" and "playable right now" are different
 * claims and the card must not merge them.
