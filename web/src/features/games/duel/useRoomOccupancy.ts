/**
 * How many people are waiting, read with no wallet and no signature.
 *
 * This is the answer to "is anyone even here?", and it has to be available before the room asks for
 * anything — a player deciding whether a duel is worth a signature cannot be told to sign first. It is
 * deliberately thin: counts per queue and how many pairs are past it, no wallets, no ratings, nothing
 * that says who.
 *
 * **An unreachable room is a fact, not an error.** `reachable: false` is rendered as "the room is not
 * answering", which is true and actionable, rather than as a zero — a lobby that says "0 waiting" when
 * the service is down tells a player the game is empty when it is actually off.
