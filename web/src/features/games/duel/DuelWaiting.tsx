/**
 * The two things a duel used to do silently: wait, and refuse.
 *
 * A spinner labelled "sealing the deck…" looked identical at one second and at ninety, and the room knew
 * the difference the whole time — it logs "the next deck is dealable in 47s" while the screen says
 * nothing. And a transaction refused before the wallet was ever asked put the button back where it was
 * with no word at all, which is what a wallet holding no STT experienced end to end.
 *
 * Both are drawn from facts, never from a guess. The countdown runs off the room's own `serverTimeMs`
 * plus elapsed local time rather than off a browser clock that may be minutes out, and a refusal shows
 * the diagnosis the write lane produced rather than a rewritten one.
