/**
 * A card's per-side odds, from the venue's own book rather than a model.
 *
 * Flicky prints a probability per side from its digital-BS mark (`swipe-screen.tsx` L203–222), and
 * greys the side whose premium would fall under the venue's $1 floor. DreamDEX has a resting book, so
 * the honest figure is what `sizeForStake` reports for each side at this card's stake: the walk's
 * average price per whole contract, which is what the market charges for that side right now — a
 * `58%` UP is a side that costs 0.58 per contract. The two figures do not sum to one hundred; the
 * difference is the spread, and printing it is truer than normalising it away.
 *
 * A side is `locked` when its quote reverts on the arena's own rules — too thin to fill, too late to
 * enter, not trading. That is exactly the refusal `placePick` would give, so the deck refuses the throw
 * first. An unreadable quote (an RPC blip) is not a lock: unknown odds leave both sides open, which is
 * the reference's rule for a card with no tick yet.
