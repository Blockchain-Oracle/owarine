/**
 * The duel room, as one socket and one reducer.
 *
 * Everything economic on this screen comes from `transition`, folded from messages the server built
 * out of chain logs. This hook adds no state of its own to the match: there is no local "I think I
 * picked" — the arena's own `pick.confirmed` is what moves the deck on, which is the rule doc 06
 * states as "only snapshots and events from chain and Postgres can change economic UI".
 *
 * **The seed never leaves this browser until the pairing is fixed.** A commitment goes out with the
 * queue entry, and the seed itself only after `match.found` names an opponent — so neither the
 * server nor the other player can choose theirs after seeing this one. The commitment is
 * `keccak256(seed)`, the same one line the matchmaker checks it against.
 *
 * **A dropped socket is not a lost match.** Reconnecting sends `hello` with no match id, and the
 * server answers from the arena and its projection with a whole snapshot, which the reducer treats as
 * the truth. Nothing about the previous connection is remembered on either side — which is exactly
 * why the queue is lost on a reconnect and the match is not.
