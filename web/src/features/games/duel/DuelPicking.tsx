 *
 * **A card is gated on the arena's rule, never on ours.** `phase()` calls a Window unenterable for
 * its last 300 seconds; the arena's own floor is `minCardLifeSec`, 240 at the deployed parameters.
 * Gating on ours would refuse swipes the chain would have taken — measured at 278 seconds of card
 * life, where our buffer said no and the arena quoted 11,000 raw (`context/54` §4).
 *
 * **The countdown is the earlier of two clocks.** The pick window can legally outrun the soonest
 * card's usable life, so showing the arena's `pickDeadlineSec` alone would promise seconds that are
 * already refusable.
 *
 * **A lost race is not a failure.** Both seats draw on the same book; the retry lives in the write
 * lane and the stage says what it is doing, so a player sees "asking again", not an error.
