 * Everything the duel says.
 *
 * Two claims here have to stay exactly true, because they are the ones a player would be angriest to
 * find wrong. **Free is not free of money**: a Free duel escrows no side-pot, but every pick is a real
 * capped market order on the venue, and the player keeps that position's economics either way. And
 * **nobody pays the gas but the player** — there is no sponsor on this deployment, so every pick is a
 * transaction they sign and fund themselves (`06-game-architecture.md` §Actors, keys, gas and security).
