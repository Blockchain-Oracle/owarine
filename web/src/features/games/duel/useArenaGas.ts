 * Whether this wallet can pay for the transactions a duel is about to ask of it.
 *
 * Asked at the entry rather than at the first button, because a duel is not a screen a player can back
 * out of politely: by the time "open the match" refuses, an opponent has been paired, a deck has been
 * sealed and the venue's Windows have been spent on a match nobody can create. On 2026-09-04 two
 * browsers holding 0 STT queued, paired and sealed three decks between them, and not one reached the
 * chain — the entry had never asked.
 *
 * It uses the submitter's own `checkGas` against the `arena` lane, so the number it compares against is
 * the same envelope the write lane will refuse on, rather than a second guess at it.
