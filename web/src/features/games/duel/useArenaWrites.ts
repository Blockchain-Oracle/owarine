/**
 * Every transaction a duel asks of a player: opening the match, joining it, and each pick.
 *
 * **A pick retries, and that is not defensive padding.** On a binary pool, buying UP and buying DOWN
 * draw on the same resting liquidity, so two seats swiping the same card in the same second contend
 * — the loser's fill comes back under the floor it was quoted against and the arena refuses it, as it
 * should. That is the normal case in a live duel, and it is what cost the first drive its eighth pick
 * (`context/54` §3). The stake never changes on a retry, only the floor loosens, because the arena
 * refunds whatever the walk does not spend.
 *
 * **Nothing here quotes a size the chain did not.** Every attempt re-reads `sizeForStake` immediately
 * before it sends, so a floor is always a fraction of a live quote rather than of a stale one.
