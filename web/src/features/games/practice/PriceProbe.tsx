/**
 * One asset's live feed, reported upward. Renders nothing.
 *
 * A hook cannot be called in a loop, and a deck's asset list is only known once it is dealt — so the
 * subscription becomes a component and the list becomes children. The alternative was to fix the
 * asset count at two and pass `null` for the absent one, which would quietly break the day the venue
 * lists a third.
 *
 * A stale reading is still reported: it is a real number the feed last published, and the card face
 * says how old it is. Dropping it would leave the stage priceless during exactly the outage a player
 * most needs told about.
