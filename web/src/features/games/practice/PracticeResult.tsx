 * The scoreboard.
 *
 * It is a count of cards and nothing else: no money, no rating, no streak, because practice writes
 * none of those and a number here that looked like one would be the fabrication the honesty rules
 * forbid. The one link onward is to the duel, which is where those numbers become real.
 *
 * A card the feed could not price at the close is missing from the rows and counted in one sentence
 * beneath, rather than being scored flat — "we could not read it" and "it did not move" are
 * different answers and only one of them is true.
