/**
 * The activity feed's frozen types (social-assistant.md §5) and the wire envelope that carries them.
 *
 * What each kind's fields mean, since the shape is shared:
 * - `fill`: one side of one fill. `side` is the exposure it adds (a buy of Up or a sell of Down is Up, as the
 *   sentiment cell counts it); `lots` the fill's lots; `amountBase` that leg's cost or proceeds; `signature` the tx.
 * - `resting-filled`: the same fill seen from the maker's seat — a call that rested at its own price and was taken
 *   (a scheduled call filling after the bell, D-088). Same fields as `fill`.
 * - `settled-win` / `settled-loss`: the seat's verdict, by core's settlement rule; `amountBase` the signed PnL.
 * - `voided`: the refund the held legs are owed or were paid.
 * - `claimable`: a payout still sitting in the seat; `amountBase` what it pays.
 * - `paid-automatically`: the settler's `redeem_for` paid the seat (D-032); `signature` is the crank's tx.
 * - `take`: a signed take; `takeId` names it and the envelope's `takes` carries the words.
 * - `copied`: reserved for S9/S14 (nothing writes it yet).
