/**
 * The single long-running ops service (AD-8). Each actor is a single writer over its own key and
 * registers here; every cycle logs a structured why-string, and idle is a heartbeat, never silence.
 *
 * S3 venue actors (venue-ops.md §2.5) share one session calendar and price-relay's spot feed; S6 adds the halt board
 * and the session events (session-lanes.md §3). `OPS_ACTORS` names
 * what runs: the default is the venue set; `all` adds the Masayume-era actors, which idle until their stages deploy
 * the programs they drive. DRY_RUN stays on unless `DRY_RUN=0` (nothing signs by default).
