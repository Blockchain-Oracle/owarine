/**
 * What the room does with one validated message.
 *
 * Two invariants hold across every branch. A connection is answered only after `hello`, so a client
 * cannot skip the version handshake by sending something else first. And joining a match's room requires
 * being one of its two players, checked against the arena's own record rather than against anything the
 * client said — there is no spectator seat, so a wallet that is not in the match is refused rather than
 * given a read-only view of somebody else's picks.
 *
 * The wallet a token claims is the browser key's word until the chain says otherwise — Flicky's `hello`
 * — so the seat check has a second half: once the arena names an agent for `(match, wallet)`, only a
 * socket holding that key is admitted to the seat's room. A key the entry never named is refused with
 * `wrong-key` and the match it is about, which is what the browser needs to offer a re-key.
