/**
 * The duel room actor: one `ws` listener, one hub, and nothing durable of its own.
 *
 * It refuses to listen in two cases rather than pretending. Without `ROOM_TOKEN_SECRET` every token
 * would verify, so an unset (or trivially short) secret idles the actor — the same rule the keeper
 * applies to a missing key. And with no `GameArena` on the configured chain there is no match to
 * reconstruct, so a room would be a socket that can only ever answer "unknown match".
 *
 * The context is returned so the projector and the settler can broadcast into rooms without either of
 * them owning the transport: chain events reach a browser through this one socket registry, and nothing
 * else in ops writes to a client.
