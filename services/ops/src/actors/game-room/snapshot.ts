/**
 * A whole match, rebuilt from the chain — the reconnect path, and the reason the room may hold nothing
 * durable of its own.
 *
 * Every field here comes from `matchOf`, `deckOf`, `pnlOf` and the venue's own Windows. Nothing is
 * remembered from the socket that disconnected, which is what makes "a process restart and a browser
 * reconnect both reconstruct an active match" a property of the design rather than of an uptime target.
 *
 * The two facts the record cannot carry are handled explicitly rather than guessed at:
 *
 * - **The winner** is not a stored field, but it is derivable exactly. `finalize` awards a forfeited
 *   match to the seat whose mask is complete and any other to the greater PnL, and both masks survive
 *   into `FINALIZED` — so the same branch reproduces the contract's own answer.
 * - **A refund's reason** is only in its event. Three of the four are unambiguous from the record; a
 *   creator who withdrew an unjoined match and one whose join window simply ran out are the same state,
 *   and both mean "the creator got their pot back and nobody else was involved". The projector, which
 *   sees `MatchRefunded`, is what will name that one precisely.
