/**
 * Who is connected, and which match they are watching.
 *
 * Everything here is process memory with no durability on purpose (`06-game-architecture.md`: "Queue,
 * presence, typing and reactions are process memory with TTL"). A restart drops it all and loses
 * nothing that matters — the match is on chain, its history is in Postgres, and a reconnecting client
 * is answered with a snapshot rebuilt from both. What must NOT be here is anything a snapshot cannot
 * rebuild, which is why the hub holds no state about picks, pots or ratings.
 *
 * One wallet may hold several connections — two tabs, or a phone finishing a swipe while a laptop
 * watches — so rooms are keyed by connection and presence is folded by wallet.
