/**
 * What the arena will accept for one match right now — every crank's precondition, restated from
 * `GameArena.sol` in one place and decided without a signer.
 *
 * The contract is the authority; this only avoids sending a transaction it would revert. Getting a
 * precondition wrong here costs a wasted send, not a wrong outcome — which is exactly why it is worth
 * writing down rather than "try it and see": on Somnia a reverted `settleCard` still burns the gas of a
 * book walk, and a settler that guesses wrong every cycle is a slow leak of the operator's STT.
 *
 * Every action here is permissionless by design (`06-game-architecture.md` §Actors): the settler holds a
 * key to pay gas, never to decide anything. If it stops, any player — or anyone at all — can crank the
 * same calls and the money still goes where the arena already recorded it should.
