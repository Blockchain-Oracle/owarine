/**
 * The duel settler: one key, cranking what the contract already lets anyone crank.
 *
 * It decides nothing. Every call it makes is permissionless — lock, settle, finalize, refund — so the
 * only thing this key buys is *promptness*: without it a player waits for someone to press the button,
 * and with it they do not. That is why it can be dry-run, restarted or switched off without anyone's
 * money being at risk, and why it is the actor to run last and worry about least.
 *
 * Its worklist is the projection, not a memory: whatever the database says is still live gets read from
 * the arena and decided on its own record. So a restarted settler picks up mid-match, and two settlers
 * running at once merely make each other's calls revert as already-done rather than paying twice.
