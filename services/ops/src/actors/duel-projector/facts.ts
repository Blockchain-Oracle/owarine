/**
 * What the projector has to know about a match beyond the event in front of it.
 *
 * Two facts do not travel on every log. A pick's *seat* — which the pick key needs — is only knowable
 * from the match's two addresses, and a settlement's *cost* is only on the pick that preceded it. A
 * process that has run since the match was created has both; one that started or restarted in the
 * middle has neither, and inventing them would put a wrong PnL on a screen.
 *
 * So this cache is chain-backed rather than memory-only: a miss reads the match, which returns the
 * addresses and every pick the arena has recorded, and the projector carries on. A restart therefore
 * costs one read per live match, not a wrong number.
