/**
 * The queue, the pairing and the seed ceremony — process memory with a chain-backed conscience.
 *
 * Nothing here is durable on purpose. A restart empties the queue, and the correct behaviour is that
 * every queued player is simply not queued any more: nobody has paid anything, no commitment has been
 * published, and a client that reconnects sees an idle snapshot and can queue again. What a restart must
 * NOT lose is a deck that was committed, and that is why the deckmaster writes before it commits.
 *
 * The order of operations is the honest one, and it is worth stating because it is easy to shorten:
 *
 *   join → pair → both seeds revealed → deck dealt and made durable → commitment sent
 *
 * A commitment is the first thing either player can act on, so nothing is published until the seeds are
 * in and the reveal is safe. Neither player, and not the server, can choose a seed after seeing another.
 *
 * **A queue entry is the client's, and only the client's.** The room used to put a player back in the
 * queue itself when a pairing failed, which read as a kindness and was three bugs. It re-queued the
 * player whose socket was in the middle of closing, so a ghost with no browser behind it was paired,
 * failed the seed window fifteen seconds later, and was paired again on the same tick — a loop the live
 * opponent could not escape (measured in `ops.log`, 2026-09-04, four pairings in thirty seconds). It
 * re-queued with the seed commitment the player had *already revealed*, so the server knew the next
 * match's seed before the ceremony began. And it moved a client's queue state without telling it, which
 * is the desync the whole screen was built to avoid. Now a dissolve is announced and nothing more: the
 * browser decides whether to search again, with a fresh seed, and the room learns of it the usual way.
