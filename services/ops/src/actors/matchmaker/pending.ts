/**
 * The gap between a sealed deck and a match on chain — the one part of a duel that exists nowhere else.
 *
 * A committed deck is real: it is hashed, written to Postgres and shown to both players. But until the
 * creator's `createMatch` lands, the arena has never heard of it, so the reconnect path — which asks the
 * chain projection what a wallet is in — answers "nothing", and a browser that reloaded in this window
 * lost a match it could see a second ago. That was the whole of "I refresh and it takes me back".
 *
 * So the room keeps it, and keeps it honestly:
 *
 * - **Process memory, deliberately.** The deck's reveal material is durable (`putDeck`); this is only the
 *   pairing around it, and a restart before creation costs two players a search, not a pot. Making it
 *   durable would mean writing a match the chain may never hold.
 * - **It expires against the arena, not against a clock.** Every sweep asks whether the match has appeared
 *   on chain: found, it is the projection's problem from now on and this forgets it. Not found by the
 *   deadline, both players are told the pairing is over rather than being left on a button whose
 *   transaction nobody is going to send — which is exactly where this session's two browsers stalled.
 */

/**
 * How long a sealed deck waits for its creator's transaction.
 *
 * It is the arena's own join window that this is really protecting: every second before creation is spent
 * on top of the deadlines counted from it, and the deck's headroom was budgeted with `CREATE_LATENCY_SEC`
 * in mind. Two minutes is a human reading a wallet prompt twice over, and short enough that a player who
 * walked away does not hold their opponent for the whole of the deck's life.
