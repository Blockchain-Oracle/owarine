/**
 * Sealing a deck's reveal material, and keeping a second copy of it somewhere else.
 *
 * Two failures are being defended against, and they are not the same failure.
 *
 * **Someone reading the store** would hold a preimage that opens a deck early, because `revealDeck` is
 * permissionless — so the material is encrypted with a key that is not in the database. AES-256-GCM
 * rather than CBC or CTR: the tag means a tampered ciphertext fails to open instead of decrypting to
 * something that hashes to the wrong commitment and looks like a bug in the contract.
 *
 * **Losing the store** would strand every unopened deck, and the doc's answer is a second recoverable
 * copy. A second table in the same Postgres is not a second copy — one outage takes both — so the copy
 * is an append-only file on the operator's own disk, and it is the one written *first*. That ordering
 * makes the file the durable record and the row the queryable one, which is why a deployment with no
 * database can still deal a deck and still open it: `fromJournal` is the recovery path, and the settler
 * falls back to it. The claim "no durable reveal, no join" is enforced against the file, not the row.
